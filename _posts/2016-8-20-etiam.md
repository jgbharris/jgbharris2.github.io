Corporate Radar is a personal stock trading website which enables you to track stocks and add them to online fantasy portfolios.

Users could look at the portfolios of other users and comment on their strategy.

I used Angular charts to display in the portfolio information in a graphical format and Intrinio API to pull in real time stock data.

Build: Ruby, Postgres, AngularJS,  JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, BCrypt, Bulma, Gulp and Bower
