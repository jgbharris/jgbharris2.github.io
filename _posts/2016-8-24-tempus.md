I recently completed a three month Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly. The course focussed on core coding skills as well as soft skills such as presentations and daily standups.

The course featured four modules, each of which culminated in a project where we had the  chance to employ some of our newly learned skills.

Over the course I gained experience using:

jQuery,
HTML5,
AngularJS,
Express.js,
Node.js,
MongoDB,
Ruby,
Postgres,
SCSS,
JSON,
Gulp,
AWS,
Bower
