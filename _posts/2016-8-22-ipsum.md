As the second project during the Web Development Immersive course, this was the first RESTful app I produced.

The app is an event website which enables users to post events, upload images, keep track of attendees and add user comments.

The site also features Facebook OAuth and uses Googlemaps API to  provide location data.

Build: MongoDB, Express, Node.js, jQuery, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, BCrypt, Bootstrap and Gulp
