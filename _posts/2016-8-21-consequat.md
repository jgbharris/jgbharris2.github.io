Disaster Relief was a group project which enabled users to post a 'campaign' if they needed assistance following a tragedy.

The app calculates distances between users using Googlemaps API and uses Nodemailer to alert matching users within a given redius.

Most of my work involved the setup of the restful routes, integrating the Google Maps API, image upload, front end validation and styling the site overall.

Build: MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node.js, jQuery, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, BCrypt, Bulma, Gulp and Bower
